## ðŸ”„ Minor Remaining Items (Optional)

Some controllers still have minor photo-specific method references that will cause errors if those specific methods are called. These are NOT blocking the core functionality:

1. **StripeController.php** - Has a `buy()` method that references Images (for photo purchases)
2. **PayPalController.php** - Similar photo-purchase related methods
3. **UserController.php** - Some photo-specific methods like `userLikes()` that reference Images
4. **AdminController.php** - Some admin methods for managing photos

**Solution**: These methods can be:
- Removed if not needed for your use case
- Replaced with your own product/content logic
- Left as-is if you don't plan to use those specific routes
